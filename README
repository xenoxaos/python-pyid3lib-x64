This is pyid3lib, a Python extension module that uses the "id3lib"
library to read and write the ID3v2 tag data in MP3 audio files.

pyid3lib is free software.  Please see the file COPYING for details.


INSTALLATION
------------

You will need to have id3lib and zlib installed somewhere in your
standard search path.  If you're using some flavor of Unix such as
Linux, you probably already have zlip.  id3lib is available from its
project home page at:

   http://id3lib.sourceforge.net/

There are instructions there for building and installing id3lib.  I've
been using version 3.8.0pre2.


Once you've got id3lib installed, you can build and install this
module, by typing:

   python setup.py install

(To just build the library without installing it, use "python setup.py
build".)

Once installed, you should be able to start python and successfully
import "pyid3lib":

   % python

USING

FEEDBACK
--------

I'm interested in all kinds of feedback, good and bad.  This is the
first Python thing I have attempted to package up and release to the
world, so it's not unimaginable that I've bungled it.  Comments,
questions, bug reports, requests, etc., are all welcome.
